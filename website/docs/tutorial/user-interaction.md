## Obligatory “Hello, world!”

Fine, here's your “hello, world”.

This first one uses the `alert` command to display an informative message box. It is analogous to AppleScript’s `display alert`, or browser JavaScript’s `alert()`.

```
alert "Hello, world!"
```

An alternative “hello, world” in BushelScript uses the `log` command to print to standard output. You will only see the results of this program if you run it from the command line (run `bushelscript --help` for assistance with that). A log view is planned for BushelScript Editor but is not yet implemented.

```
log "Hello, world!"
```
