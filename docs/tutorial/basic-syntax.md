Syntax is the visible structure of language. BushelScript has stricter syntactic rules than natural languageâ€”you can't just tell it to "make coffee"â€”but as programming languages go, it's relatively lenient.

See also: [Language Reference](../ref/basic-syntax).

## Comments

You can write _comments_ to help people understand your code. Use them to explain the behavior, purpose or design of complicated code, to help others adapt your code to their needs, or even to share ASCII art (please don't).

Your programs will work just fine without any comments. Then again, your car would work just fine without an instruction manual. What and why you comment is really up to you.

There are two syntactic kinds of comments:

### Line comments

_Line comments_ start with two hypens `--` and continue to the end of the current line. They never extend over multiple lines.

```applescript
-- I'm a line comment
-- You can write whatever you like here.
-- The computer doesn't care!
-- Though other humans probably will ðŸ˜‰

this is not a line comment and will probably cause an error

-- You can have empty line comments if you want:
--
```
### Block comments

_Block comments_ start with two hyphens and an opening parenthesis `--(`, and they continue across any number of lines until a closing parenthesis and two more hyphens are reached `)--`.

```applescript
--( Single-line block comments are possible )--
--( Multi-line
    block comments
    are too )--
--(
    Whatever style
    
    floats your boat.
)--

```

## Values

_Values_ are abstract "objects" with identity, like numbers. Every value belongs to a type class, discussed later in [1-4: Object Types](object-types).

### Numbers

Type a number to produce a number value. Whole numbers are of type `integer`, while numbers with fractional components are of type `real`.

```applescript
123 -- integer
1.23 -- real
```

### `string`, a sequence of characters

Type anything between quotation marks to produce a `string`, which is a fancy name for a glob of text, like a character, word, sentence, or doctoral thesis.

```applescript
-- Note that each of these lines produces a string that is
-- immediately discarded; none of this actually does
-- much of anything.
-- That is to say, don't write real programs like this.

"a"
"string"
"is composed of one or more letters, or digits 1234567890, or"
"anything, really."

"To include a quotation mark character in a string, type"
"a backslash like this \" to \"escape\" it."
"Strings can also be empty, like this next one:"
""
```

### `boolean`, truth and falsity

Type `true` to produce a value representing truth and `false` for a value representing falsity.

These `boolean` values are more typically produced when we posit something that can be confirmed or defined (ask a yes/no question). For example, "1 is a number" is, under usual definitions, indisputably true (a tautology, if you will), and "the character count of the most recent tweet on Twitter is 49" may or may not be true, depending on the state of the world when we ask the question.

```applescript
true -- boolean
false -- boolean
1 = 2 -- boolean (more on this below)
```

### `null`, the absence of a value

Finally, you can type `null` to get a value that represents the lack of an otherwise meaningful value. For instance, if I asked "what is your great grandson's birthday?" and you replied that you don't have a great grandson, we could represent this formally as `null`â€”a placeholder for the lack of a birthday value.

```
null
```

## Commands

_Commands_ are actions like `add`, `remove`, `search`, and `send`. They can take data as input and produce data as output, and they may have additional effects.

We can _invoke_ or _call_ a command by simply typing its name. For example, `alert` is the built-in command that we used in [Step 1: User Interaction](user-interaction):

```applescript
alert
```

### Direct object arguments

Here, we haven't given `alert` anything to display. We can tell it to show a `string` like this:

```applescript
alert "some message"
```

The input values we give to a command are called _arguments_, and this particular argument is a _direct object argument_. Direct object arguments come right after the name of the action. Another example is:

```applescript
cos 3.14159265
```

Here, the `real` approximation of Ï€ is a direct object argument. Note that we don't _have_ to provide a direct object argument, and we cannot provide more than one.

### Named arguments

We can provide additional input as _named arguments_. To do this, we type the name of a parameter that the command defines, and follow that with the value. For example:

```applescript
send "Hey!" to "ian@example.com"
```

This (hypothetical) command receives two arguments from this call: The direct object argument `"Hey!"`, and the named argument `"ian@example.com"`. We could also leave out the direct object argument, provided the command doesn't require it:

```applescript
download from "https://example.com/"
```
Or we could specify multiple named arguments:

```applescript
login to "Google" username "ian@example.com" password "password123"
```

## Operators

_Operators_ are special built-in commands that act as mathematical functions in the sense that they have no extra side-effects.

Common mathematical operators such as `+` (add) and `*` (multiply) are defined. For a full list, see the [Language Reference](../ref/basic-syntax#operators).
