BushelScript, being a programming language, has syntax which must be adhered to.

See also: [Quick Tutorial](../tutorial/basic-syntax).

## Comments

_Comments_ are pieces of text embedded in a program that are intended only to aid human readers. They have no formal semantic effect on the program; adding or removing comments does not change what a program does.

### [Line comments](grammar#sequence)

_Line comments_ begin with `--` and continue to the end of their line.

### [Block comments](grammar#blank)

_Block comments_ begin with `--(` and continue through to new lines, until either `)--` or the end of the program is reached.

## Values

### [Numbers](grammar#literal)

#### [`integer`s](grammar#literal)

Positive and negative whole numbers, no fractions. Any numeric literal in the appropriate range and without a decimal point produces an `integer`. `integer`s store signed 64-bit values, which means -2‚Å∂¬≥ ‚â§ ùë• < 2‚Å∂¬≥ for all `integer`s ùë•.

#### [`real`s](grammar#literal)

Positive and negative numbers with fractions allowed. A numeric literal with a `.` decimal point produces a `real`.

`real`s use double-precision [floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) format. This provides a huge range of representable values, but can cause imprecision in base-10 calculations: `real`s are stored as ùë† √ó 2‚Åø, where ùë† and ùëõ are integers, but not all decimal numbers can be represented exactly in this format.

### [`string`](grammar#literal)

A `string` is a sequence of Unicode characters. If it's text, it goes in a `string`.

```
"abc"
"this is a string value"
"üòÄüòÉüòÑ" -- length 3 (grapheme clusters, not UTF-16 units)
```

### [`boolean`, truth and falsity](grammar#literal)

A `boolean` represents the answer to a yes-or-no question. It can be reacted to by [control flow constructs](control-flow) or factored into [logical operations](#binary-operators).

```
true
false
true and false --> false
false or true --> true
```

### [`null`, the absence of a value](grammar#literal)

`null` indicates the absence of a meaningful value. Its effective semantics depend on the context of its use.

`null` is the sole value of [raw form](terms#raw-form) [type](terms#term-roles) `¬´type ae4:msng¬ª`, which is called `missing value` in AppleScript. It is [encoded](resources#remote-invocations) as this type object when sent in an AppleEvent.

```
null
null as boolean --> false
```

Parameters without corresponding arguments in a [function](functions) [invocation](#command-invocations) are set to `null` in the function body:

```
on build greeting: to name
  -- 'name' is null if the 'to' parameter is omitted
  alert name
  -- null as a boolean is false
  "Hello" & (if name then (", " & name) else "") & "!"
end

build greeting --> "Hello!"
alert that

build greeting to "Billy" --> "Hello, Billy!"
alert that
```

## Commands

_Commands_ are units of operation. They take and produce data, and may have additional effects.

### Parameters

Inputs to a command are called its _parameters_. The caller provides their values.

### Result

The output of a command is called its _result_. It is available to the caller after it has received control back from a call.

### Side-effects

Commands often have _side-effects_; that is, they modify outside state in addition to producing a result. Side-effects are necessary for a program to really do anything, but they can also make code harder to debug. Commands without side-effects are analogous to mathematical functions.

### [Command invocations](grammar#invocation)

A command is _invoked_ by naming it. This produces a _command invocation_ expression, which passes _arguments_ to the command's parameters and evaluates to its result.

### Precise terminology

To be as clear and precise as possible, here is a table summarizing what each confusingly similar command-related term precisely means:

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| call                | A single evaluation of a command with a certain set of inputs. Often but not strictly produced by invocations. |
| invocation          | An expression that generates a command call, using a certain set of arguments, and evaluates to its result.    |
| parameter           | A term with which argument values can be associated in an invocation or call. e.g., `new` in `make new window`. |
| argument            | An input value from the point of view of an invocation. Is ephemeral and constant on a per-invocation basis.   |

## [Operators](grammar#invocation)

_Operators_ are built-in commands that hvae no side-effects and special invocation syntax.

Each operator has an assigned _precedence_ ranking. This will be elaborated on as soon as some issues get ironed out.

### Unary operators

_Unary operators_ require one operand.

#### [Unary prefix operators](grammar#invocation)

_Unary prefix operators_ are positioned before their operand.

| Syntax | Name      | Result                                              |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `not`  | Unary NOT | The negation of the operand coerced to a `boolean`. |

### Binary operators

_Binary operators_ require two operands.

#### [Binary infix operators](grammar#invocation)

_Binary infix operators_ are positioned in-between their operands.

| Syntax                                                                                                                                       | Name                                                     | Result                                                                                                                                                   |
