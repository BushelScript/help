## Early return

Control automatically returns from a function after its last sequenced expression is evaluated. However, you can also return explicitly using the `return` keyword:

```
-- Tells the user something on the hour
on notify user: for date
  if (minutes of date) â‰  0 then return false
  
  alert "New hour!" message "It's now " & ((hours of date) as string) & ":00."
  true
end

repeat while not (notify user for current date)
  delay 60
end
```
